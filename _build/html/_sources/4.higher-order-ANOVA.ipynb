The additive assumption has placed a *constraint* on the model, producing adjusted cell means that allow this assumption to work. Because these differ from the actual cells, the model will not fit as well as a model that lifts this constraint. As we saw above, the additive model assumes that there is a *constant* row difference and a *constant* column difference. But what if that was not true? What is the row difference actually depends upon the column, or if the column difference actually depends upon the row? The fact that the additive model had to use cell means that are different to the true means suggests that this is in fact what is going on. This effect is known as an *interaction*. "
