    "... Beware of this reasoning. Although planned tests are more *credible* in the sense that you are not $p$-hacking, this does not change anything about the error rate. The error does not magically know what your intentions were and then change itself. The error rate is a fact of multiple testing that does not change with intent. As such, even if you have pre-specified tests, you still need to control for multiple comparisons."
