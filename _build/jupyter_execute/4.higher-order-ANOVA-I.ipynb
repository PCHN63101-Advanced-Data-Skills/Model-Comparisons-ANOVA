    "## The Higher-order ANOVA Framework\n",
    "To begin with, it is important that we establish some terminology and core concepts about factorial experimental designs. This is especially important for ANOVA models, because many of these concepts directly inform the mechanics of how an ANOVA model works. This is by design, as the ANOVA was original developed by Fisher as a principles way of analysing data from factorial designs. As such, we need to understand the concepts behind the experiment in order to understand the analysis."

    "### Terminology\n",
    "When we talk about ANOVA models, we usually do so with specific reference to both the number of factors and the number of levels. We saw this earlier with a 1-way ANOVA, so-called because it only has *one* factor. For higher-order ANOVA models, we typical refer to them in the following way. If the model contains two factors, we would call it a 2-way ANOVA. If each factor had 2 levels, we could refer to the specific model as a $2 \\times 2$ ANOVA. Here, each number represents a factor, with the value of the number indicative of the number of levels. For instance, if the second factor had 3 levels, we would call it a $2 \\times 3$ ANOVA. Similarly, if there were 3 factors, we would have a 3-way ANOVA. If each factor had two levels we could call it a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ ANOVA. If the second factor had 3 levels and the third had 5 levels it would be a $2 \\times 3 \\times 5$ ANOVA, and so on. Hopefully the pattern is clear."

If we think of the experiment in terms of a *table* then the number of *cells* is given by the multiplication of the factor levels. The simplest example is a $2 \\times 2$ ANOVA that can be represented using a table with $2 \\times 2 = 4$ cells. For instance\n",

The marginal mean for level 1 of Factor A is therefore $(\\mu_{11} + \\mu_{12})/2 = \\mu_{1.}$. Here, the dot subscript is shorthand for an index that has been averaged-over.

However, if the data does not adhere to additivity, the estimated cell means and the sample cell means will be *different*. The degree to which the model does not fit the actual sample means is therefore indicative of the degree to which the additivity assumption does not hold.

    "In the previous part of this lesson, we discussed the concept of an *omnibus test* as an overall reflection of whether any of the mean differences across the levels of a categorical predictor are non-zero. This idea carries-over into higher-order ANOVA models. The main difference is that our null models are rarely intercept-only. Instead, we include all other factors in the null model *except* the factor of interest. The logic is that the additional factors may relate to the outcome variable and thus should be included in the null model. This is so that the error is as accurate as possible and does not accidentally contain any sources of systematic variation which would make it larger than it should be. Another way of thinking about this is that the omnibus null for one variable is not based on assuming that there are *no relationships with any other variables*. As such, the null model simply involves removing a *single variable*, not all of them[^reganova-foot]."
