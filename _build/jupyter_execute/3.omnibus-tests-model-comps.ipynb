    "# Omnibus Tests and Model Comparisons\n",

Although we called this a One-way ANOVA model, we have yet to connect what we have done with the familiar ANOVA table. In this section, we will complete the picture by discussing the nature of the ANOVA omnibus tests and showing how these are effectively *model comparisons*.

    "The traditional argument is one of *error control* in relation to the problem of *multiple testing* or *multiple comparisons*. If our categorical variable has $k$ levels, then there are $m = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ comparisons we can make between the levels. If our desired error level is given by $\\alpha$, then across all tests the probability of *at least one* being significant is $1 - (1 - \\alpha)^{m}$. This is known as the *familywise error rate* (FWER). So, notice that whenever $m > 1$ our desired error-rate will be scaled by the number of tests and therefore get *bigger*. \n",

This is where an omnibus test helps because, irrespective of the value of $k$, the FWER stays at the desired $\\alpha$ because it is only a *single test*. So, we can have a factor with many levels and can assess all the differerences simultaneously using a single test that does not inflate the FWER.\n",

Because of these approaches, there is a sense that traditional statistical inference actively *punishes* researchers for wanting to investigate and explore their data. This is not universal of all statistical methods. For instance, Bayesian statistics allows as many comparisons as you want without disturbing the probabilistic structure of the conclusions. So just know that ominbus tests and the multiple comparisons problem are not *universal* in statistics, rather they are a consequence of one particular school of thought and one particular definition of probability.\n",

    "If our reduction in variance were of a similar magnitude to the amount left over, we could not say with any certainty that it was a true effect because the \"effect\" and the \"error\" look basically the same. However, in this case, the reduction in error variance is *much larger* than the amount left over, which is already suggestive of some true effect and thus that including `origin` in the model allows for a much better model fit. Because the `origin` factor allows for the group means to differ, this implies that *at least* one pair of group means are different from each other. This connects this result directly to our original omnibus hypothesis."

    "As we can see, some of the confusion around ANOVAs and ANOVA calculations simply comes down to using *different names* for familiar quantities. The name ANOVA tells us that the method involves comparing variances, yet those variances are called *mean-squares*. Usually, we would not give a name to the intermediate quantities produced during the calculation of variances, but the ANOVA names them as *sums-of-squares*. These quantities take on more importance within an ANOVA, because the sums-of-squares are the only meaningful way to compare two model fits, before they can be scaled back into variances. However, this creates a confusing collection of sums-of-squares, mean squares and degrees of freedom. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember*, all we are doing is comparing two models using their residuals. That is it. Try not to get too lost in the specifics of *how* this is done and keep focus on the very simple aim of the ANOVA. Remember as well that the ANOVA table was introduced by Fisher as a convenient way of organising all the arithmetic. The table was designed to make the calculations less confusing, but the table is *not* the ANOVA itself. There is nothing in an ANOVA table that implies any form of model comparison, but this is exactly what it is showing. As we will see below, in `R` such a table can be produce by *directly* comparing two models, making this perspective event clearer.\n",

    "#### The Definition of $F$\n",
    "So, given everything we have discussed above, we have taken a rather long and winding road to the definition of the $F$-statistic, which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{SS_{B} / df_{1}}{SS_{W} / df_{2}} = \\frac{MS_{B}}{MS_{W}} = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{\\text{effect}}}{\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{\\text{error}}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic, the $F$-ratio is compaing two measures of variance. Hence the name, Analysis of *Variance*. If we want to make this even simpler, we can say \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = \\frac{\\text{Improvement in error between the null and full models}}{\\text{Error remaining}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, to put this a difference way, how much variance have we managed to explain for each parameter we have added compared to how much we still have left to explain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that $F$ is a *ratio*, we can think of its value in fairly simple terms. If $F = 1$ then the magnitude of the improvement is the same as the magnitude of the error. This is what we would expect if the null hypothesis were true, because any improvement is indistinguishable from normal sampling error. However, if $F > 1$, it means that the improvement is much larger than the error. The bigger this value becomes, the more the improvement dwarfs the error and the harder it becomes to believe that all we have captured is noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the $F$ is the ratio of two *estimates* ($\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{\\text{effect}}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}^{2}_{\\text{error}}$), and because each estimate is a *random variable*, the $F$-ratio itself is a random variable with some distribution. Under the null hypothesis that there is no effect, $\\sigma^{2}_{\\text{effect}} = \\sigma^{2}_{\\text{error}}$ and the $F$-ratio will be 1 on average, as indicated above. The null $F$-distribution, as derived from our original assumptions of normality, has a form where the expected value is 1. This makes the null $F$-distribution only *one-tailed*, as illustrated below for an example $F_{2,29}$."

In other words, this is nearly 8 times bigger than our expectation under the null hypothesis of no differences between the group means. The probability of achieving a value of $F_{2,29} = 7.80$ if the null were true is $p = 0.002$, which is below the usual NHST threshold of $p = 0.05$, thus this would be declared \"significant\" within this framework.

As such, it would be a bit unreasonable if we were expected to perform all this arithmetic manually every time we wanted to compare two models. Luckily, `R` can do all of this very easily for us using the `anova()` function. All we do is provide the function with two models (or more) and `R` will produce an ANOVA table of all the calculations, along with an $F$-statistic and $p$-value."
