    "# One-way ANOVA\n",
    "In the previous section, we saw how dummy variables can be incorporated into a regression model to represent a categorical predictor. We also saw how this can produce *identical* results to a traditional $t$-test. Now it is time to take this further and see how dummy variable regression can also be equivalent to a traditional Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The starting point for this is the basic *One-way ANOVA*, where we have a *single* categorical predictor with $> 2$ levels. As we will see, this is simply a generalisation of the $t$-test we have already seen.\n",

    "However, this is *not* the ANOVA. In reality, an ANOVA is a very basic *linear model* concerned with *group means*. The ANOVA table is simply a convenient way to organise the arithmetic of hypothesis tests. The term *Analysis of Variance* comes from the way that these hypothesis tests are determined, but the estimates that these hypotheses are actually about come from a *model*. Traditional statistical education in Psychology tends to skip the actual model and go straight to the hypothesis tests. But this is not what we are going to do. Instead, we will ignore the ANOVA table for the moment and start by focusing on the *true form* of the ANOVA as a *basic linear model of group means*."

However, if the group means are quite different from each other, they will be much further away from the grand mean and the deviations will be *larger*. So, the magnitude of the $\\alpha_{j}$'s tells us precisely how different the group means are from each other. Indeed, if there were *no* differences between the means then the group means would be the same as the grand mean and $\\alpha_{1} = \\alpha_{2} = \\dots = \\alpha_{k} = 0$.\n",

The $\\alpha_{j}$ then tells us how far we have to travel to reach the mean of group $j$. So $\\mu + \\alpha_{j} = \\mu_{j}$, the mean of group $j$. In order to reach observation $i$ from that point, we need to walk a final $\\epsilon_{ij}$ number of steps.

To begin with, there is a clearer link here with regression models that constrain an intercept (constant) and a slope. This will make mapping the ANOVA on to a regression model simpler. In addition, when we come to add *more predictors* to the ANOVA, each one can be conceptualised as a separate deviation from the grand mean. So, a model with an additional factor can be written as\n",

    "where the additional factor is hidden within the subscripts. This becomes even more important when we talk about an ANOVA as a model comparison procedure, because we need to add and remove different predictors from the model. This is much clearer to do when the predictors are represented by explicit terms, rather than hidden in the definition of a mean. Finally, thinking about elements of a model as *deviations* from a constant will be helpful for more complex circumstances, such as mixed-effects model, which we will cover later in the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from practical considerations, there are also some conceptual advantages to spelling the ANOVA out this way. To see why, consider the analogy of the model equation providing travel instructions to reach each data point. From this perspective, the model $y_{ij} = \\mu_{j} + \\epsilon_{ij}$ is like starting from 0 and then travelling $\\mu_{j}$ steps to reach the group mean. The problem here is that most of that journey relates to the *units* of the data, rather than anything meaningful about our experiment. For instance, if we have measured reaction time in milliseconds, we will need to travel thousands of units to reach the data, but most of that journey has nothing to do with our experimental manipulations. If instead we *start* at the grand mean, then this scaling has already been taken care of and we start in a more reasonable position. In a way, the grand mean serves to start us in a decent place, separating out the experimental effects from the magnitude of the units. At the risk of stretching this metaphor too far, it is the difference between instructions for climbing a mountain starting from the base of the mountain, or including all the steps to travel to the base of the mountain from your own front door.\n",

    "### Model Parametrisation and Constraints\n",

We have already seen two examples, where we have chosen to write the model as $E(y_{ij}) = \\mu + \\alpha_{j}$ instead of $E(y_{ij}) = \\mu_{j}$. Remember, the most important element of an ANOVA model is that the model predictions are always the *group means*. These are the least-squares estimates as well as the maximum likelihood estimates. So, no matter how we want to write the model, the best estimates will always be the sample means. \n",

    "In effect, we want two numbers that add up to $\\mu_{j}$, the sample mean. The problem is that there are literally an *infinite* number of possible choices here. For instance, if $\\mu_{1} = 6$, we could choose $\\mu = 5$ and $\\alpha_{1} = 1$, or $\\mu = 200$ and $\\alpha_{1} = -194$, or $\\mu = -3,467$ and $\\alpha_{1} = 3,473$ and so on. This is know as the model being *overparametrised* or *unidentifiable*. If we try to use this model in a computer, the computer will not be able to find a unique single set of parameters because the options are, quite literally, *limitless*. This is not just a problem in a computer. If you tried to find the parameter values that maximise the likelihood, you would find yourself dealing with an infinite number of possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop this from happening and to force the model to choose one possibility out of the infinity of options, we have to impose a *constraint*. Think of this as adding some *rule* to finding parameters that allows the computer (or person) to settle on one possible solution. Although these constraints could be *anything*, we typically choose between constraints that lead to useful values of the parameters. Whilst $\\mu = -3,467$ and $\\alpha_{1} = 3,473$ would work (because the predicted value is still $\\mu_{1}$), neither of these values are particularly useful or meaningful. However, if we impose the constraint that $\\sum{\\alpha_{j}} = 0$, then the *only* choice is that $\\mu$ is the grand mean and the $\\alpha_{j}$ are deflections from the grand mean.

    "At this point, we should have a sense of the more formal linear model specification of a one-way ANOVA *and* should have a sense of how we can create this same model within the context of linear regression by using dummy variables. However, we have only seen this for cases where the categorical predictor has 2 levels. What happens when our our predictor has *more* than 2 levels?\n",

    "The short answer is that we simply *add more dummy variables*. The general rule is that for $k$ levels of a predictor we need to add $k - 1$ dummy variables to the model. Notice that this fits with what we have already seen. For a two-sample $t$-test, $k = 2$ and we had to add $2 - 1 = 1$ dummy variable to the model. If it were a one-sample $t$-test, we would have $k = 1$ and we would add $1 - 1 = 0$ dummy variables to the model (because we only need an intercept). For the most basic one-way ANOVA case where $k = 3$, we therefore need to add $3 - 1 = 2$ dummy variables to the model. "

So we explicitly model $k-1$ levels of the categorical predictor and let the $k\\text{th}$ level fall into the intercept. If we were to add $k$ levels then the model will become unidentifiable (because the choice of estimates is infinite) and it would not work. `R` will not let you do this when it makes its own dummy variables, but you can try it for yourself and see what happens if you manually create as many dummy variables as factor levels.\n",

Furthermore, the automatic tests on the slope parameters are equivalent to performing $t$-tests on two of the possible mean differences across the levels of `origin`. On this basis, we could immediately draw some conclusions about the differences in MPG between these categories. For instance, if we want to use NHST for inference, we could say that there is a significant difference between the average MPG of USA cars and European cars ($t_{29} = -2.929, p < 0.01$), but not between the average MPG of Japanese cars and European cars ($t_{29} = 1.434, p = 0.16$).

Remember, the only difference between doing this manually and letting `R` do it automatically is whether other functions inside `R` \"know\" that the two dummy variable actually represent a single categorical variable. Without this knowledge, everything else inside `R` will treat them as two separate binary variables."
