    "# Omnibus Tests and Model Comparisons\n",
    "In the previous section, we saw how to use dummy variables with multiple categorical levels and then specify a subsequent regression model that fits group means and mean differeces. Although we called this a One-way ANOVA model, it probably does not look much like an ANOVA to you yet. In this section, we will complete the picture by discussing the nature of the ANOVA omnibus tests and showing how these are effectively *model comparisons*. The familiar ANOVA table is simply a way of displaying the results of several model comparisons. We will show how to generate this within `R` and also show how the values within this table relate to comparing different regression models."

An omnibus test of this hypothesis is able to simultaneously compare *all possible mean differences*. Within the NHST framework, a significant omnibus effect suggests that *at least one* of all possible mean differences is significant. Traditionally, we would then drill-down to see which of the differences is driving the omnibus effect[^omnibus-foot]."

If our categorical variable has $k$ levels, then there are $m = \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$ comparisons we can make between the levels. If our desired error level is given by $\\alpha$, then across all tests the probability of *at least one* being significant is $1 - (1 - \\alpha)^{m}$. This is known as the *familywise error rate* (FWER). So, notice that whenever $m > 1$ our desired error-rate will be scaled by the number of tests and therefore get *bigger*. \n",

This is where an omnibus test helps because, irrespective of the value of $k$, the FWER stays at the desired $\\alpha$ because it is only a *single test*. So, we can have a factor with many levels and can assess all the differerences simultaneously using a single test that does not inflate the FWER.\n",

Because of these approaches, there is a sense that traditional statistical inference actively *punishes* researchers for wanting to investigate and explore their data. This is not universal of all statistical methods. For instance, Bayesian statistics allows as many comparisons as you want without disturbing the probabilistic structure of the conclusions. So just know that ominbus tests and the multiple comparisons problem are not *universal* in statistics, rather they are a consequence of one particular school of thought and one particular definition of probability.\n",

Well, at present, the $SS_{B}$ gives us a sense of how much we have reduced the error of the null model by including a specific predictor. What we want to know is whether this is *large* or *small*? More generally, we want to know whether any improvement we have seen is likely to be random noise (in which case the predictor has done *nothing* to help the model) or whether it implies something more systematic about the data (i.e. that the population means differ across the groups).\n",

However, if the predictor *was* related to the data then the null model would be missing a key component and its error would be larger than it should be. This would make $RSS_{\\text{null}}$ a poor comparison. Because of this, $RSS_{\\text{full}}$ becomes the much better choice. If the predictor *does* relate to the data then $RSS_{\\text{full}}$ will be the correct magnitude, but if the predictor *does not* relate to the data then $RSS_{\\text{full}}$ will be similar to $RSS_{\\text{null}}$.

In doing so, we can combine the two sources of information into a single standardised value that can be interpreted across different datasets. Much in the same way that a $t$-statistic is formed by dividing an *effect* by *error*, we could similarly form a statistic by calculating $\\frac{SS_{B}}{SS_{W}}$. This would tell us how large the improvement in model fit is, relative to the amount of error left over. \n",

In other words, the improvement is no bigger than what you would expect just from noise. In this situation we would typically *discount* any improvement as evidence of a genuine effect. However, if $\\frac{SS_{B}}{SS_{W}} = 2$ then the amount we have reduced the error is *twice* the amount left over. In other words, the improvement is much larger than we would expect just from noise.

However, there is some additional complexity. Although both $SS_{B}$ and $SS_{W}$ appear to be compatible, because they are both sums-of-squares, they cannot be directly compared. This is because they are both *sums*, and so their magnitude is dependant upon whatever we are summing over. If they were both summed over the same element of the model, there would be no problem. But this is not the case. As we will see below, the magnitude of $SS_{B}$ depends upon the number of model parameters, yet the magnitude of $SS_{W}$ depends upon the sample size.

The name ANOVA tells us that the method involves comparing variances, yet those variances are called *mean-squares*. Usually, we would not give a name to the intermediate quantities produced during the calculation of variances, but the ANOVA names them as *sums-of-squares*. These quantities take on more importance within an ANOVA, because the sums-of-squares are the only meaningful way to compare two model fits, before they can be scaled back into variances. However, this creates a confusing collection of sums-of-squares, mean squares and degrees of freedom. *Remember*, all we are doing is comparing two models using their residuals. That is it. Try not to get too lost in the specifics of *how* this is done and keep focus on the very simple aim of the ANOVA. Remember as well that the ANOVA table was introduced by Fisher as a convenient way of organising all the arithmetic. The table was designed to make the calculations less confusing, but the table is *not* the ANOVA itself.\n",

    "In order to compare the $SS_{B}$ and $SS_{W}$, we typically calculate a *test statistic* called $F$ (named after *Fisher*), which has a known distribution under the null. This test statistic takes the form of a *ratio* between two variance terms. The logic is to compare the amount of variance we have *explained* to the amount of variance that remains *unexplained*. This effectively gives a *signal-to-noise* ratio. The larger the value of $F$, the larger the \"signal\" is (the variance we have explained) relative to the \"noise\" (the variance we have not explained). In the context of the one-way ANOVA, this \"signal\" is based on assuming that the group means actually differ. If this assumption results in a much larger improvement in terms of explained variance relative to error variance, it suggests that the full model fits the data better than the null model. The alternative is that the improvement in explained variance is of a similar magnitude to the error variance. In this situation, we cannot tell whether any \"improvement\" is just noise, because it looks effectively the same as the error. As such, if the null were true, we would expect $F \\approx 1$. This is because there are no differences between the group means and so both $SS_{B}$ and $SS_{W}$ are capturing noise. The larger the value of $F$ becomes, the less we believe the null because the magnitude of improvement is much greater than we would expect if it were just noise. In this case, $SS_{W}$ is still capturing noise, but $SS_{B}$ is capturing something more systematic about the data. Any time we get $F > 1$ this is suggestive that the null may not be correct[^NHST-foot]. The larger $F$ becomes, the greater this suggestion becomes and the smaller the associated $p$-value. "

    "... So, the core understanding here is that the ANOVA is simply a *model comparison procedure*. The ANOVA effects usually reported within an ANOVA table are really comparisons between a model that contains that effect and a model that does not contain that effect. The *variance* within the name ANOVA is a comparison between the error variances of these models. In other words, the ANOVA is asking the question \"how much does the error reduce when we include this effect in the model?\" The table is just a helpful way of organising all these comparisons. So we can see that the ANOVA model is in fact just a form of multiple regression, and the tests associated with the ANOVA are summaries of model comparisons. This is the true way to conceptualise an ANOVA."
