    "# Omnibus Tests and Model Comparisons\n",
    "... So, the core understanding here is that the ANOVA is simply a *model comparison procedure*. The ANOVA effects usually reported within an ANOVA table are really comparisons between a model that contains that effect and a model that does not contain that effect. The *variance* within the name ANOVA is a comparison between the error variances of these models. In other words, the ANOVA is asking the question \"how much does the error reduce when we include this effect in the model?\" The table is just a helpful way of organising all these comparisons. So we can see that the ANOVA model is in fact just a form of multiple regression, and the tests associated with the ANOVA are summaries of model comparisons. This is the true way to conceptualise an ANOVA."
